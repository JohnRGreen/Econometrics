# Econometrics
This repo will contain materials for discussion section 2 of Johns Hopkins' Spring 2024 Econometrics course, taught by professor Jonathan Wright.

The "slides" folder contains the slides for each week's discussion. The "practice problems" folder contains (again, surprsise) the practice problems for each week; the solutions will also be posted once we have discussed them. The "tex" folder contains the code that compiles the slides and the practice problems, and is not something students should worry about.
